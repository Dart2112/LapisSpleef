Core Features

Option to instabreak floor blocks
Multiple Floors
Kill region
Standard lobby and arena setup
Dealing with saving player states before the game and restoring them after the game completes (A whole class for this would be good)
Having a seperate arena chat (Hook into LapisChat for this as an extra cross promotion thing)
Make sure the players dont get hungry or hurt while in the arena
Stop mobs spawning in the areana so that arena creators dont have to worry about that

Extra fun stuff I might do

Particles on block break and player fall/death
